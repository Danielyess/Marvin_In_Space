SwitchBox:

	Should be able to handle 2-4 inputs and make it so that they go through gates that can be placed like so:
		-2 Input:
			_They just go into 1 gate and give the result
			_1 goes into the gate straight up and the other can have a simple gate on its path: 1 goes to OR, other goes into a NOT and then OR
			_Both go into NOT or BUFFER gates
		-3 Input (here there will be a lot of things that can happen):
			_1 goes into a 2 input gate, 1 into a simple gate, and then the 2 results go into a 2 input gate
			_1 of the inputs split and goes into both 2 input gates and the 2 results go into a 2 input gate (splitting makes it so that both sides have the same state)
			_
